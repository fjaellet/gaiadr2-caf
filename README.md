### Supplementary material for the [A&A Letter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01690)

This repository contains two jupyter notebooks that allow you to reproduce the figures and analysis presented in [Anders et al. 2020, A&A, accepted](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01690):

* [gaia_dr2_cluster_age_function.ipynb](gaia_dr2_cluster_age_function.ipynb) contains the code to reproduce the figures shown in the article.
* [gaia_dr2_clusters_completeness.ipynb](https://github.com/fjaellet/gaidr2-caf/blob/master/gaia_dr2_clusters_completeness.ipynb) contains the completeness analysis we applied to correct the cluster age distribution for (age-dependent) incompleteness.
